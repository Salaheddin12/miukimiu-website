miukimiu-portfolio
==================

Just my portfolio with svg, sass, html and some jquery

All that I know I learned on the web, with other front-end developers. Searching on google, youtube tutorials and so on. I love people who share codes!

So, I decided to put my website on github to be openly accessible. You can comment, expanded and/or fork!

If you use my code please try to give your personal look. :D

Thank you for read this!
