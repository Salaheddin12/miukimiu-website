        Hi, my name is Miuki Miu (real name Elizabet) and I’m a UX/UI Designer &
        Developer living in Dublin, Ireland.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I’m friendly and eager to work and learn with others. Each position I
        have held has broadened my skill set and career goals towards
        forward-thinking technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am obsessed with expanding my craft, solving challenging problems and
        staying on the bleeding edge. I have a passion for creating, and
        discovering, new and effective digital experiences. My friends say that
        I'm a geek, but I like to say that I'm a friendly geek. I like to
        travel, making music and create open source projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently employed at Showtime Analytics working on UI Design, Data
        Visualisation and developing our Design System.
