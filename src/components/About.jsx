          Hello there! <Emoji symbol="ðŸ‘‹" label="wave" />
        </h2>
        <p>
          My name is Miuki Miu (real name Elizabet{" "}
          <Emoji symbol="ðŸ™ƒ" label="crazy" />
          ). I'm a designer who codes or probably a developer who loves to
          design!
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my career as a web developer and soon I realized that I like
          to be in the more visual aspects of the web. I love interaction
          design, front-end technologies, animations and I'm obsessed with
          making the web fun again!
        </p>
        <p>
          I love open source technologies and in April 2018, my project React
          Kawaii won the award "Fun Project of the Year" at React Amsterdam.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love music and I was the first female solo hip-hop artist
          signing with a major label in Portugal, Universal Music. My music
          reached the top positions of the Portuguese MTV charts, but soon I
          realized that I was not meant to be an artist!
        </p>
        <p>
          I found out that I'm much happier doing code, design and sometimes
          giving some talks around the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently employed at Elastic, working on Product Design. In my
          free time, I'm probably working in one of my projects!
