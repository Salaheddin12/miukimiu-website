        Hi, my name is Miuki Miu (real name Elizabet) and I’m a UX/UI Designer & Developer living in Dublin, Ireland.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I’m friendly and eager to work and learn with others. Each position I have held has broadened my skill set and career goals towards forward-thinking technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am obsessed with expanding my craft, solving challenging problems and staying on the bleeding edge. I have a passion for creating, and discovering, new and effective digital experiences. My friends say that I'm a geek, but I like to say that I'm a friendly geek. I like to travel, making music and create open source projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently employed at Showtime Analytics working on UI Design, Data Visualisation and developing our Design System.
