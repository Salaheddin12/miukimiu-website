      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm the girl that started doing websites as a hobby and one day realised that it could be my job. I self-taught myself how to be an UI developer, learning from tutorials on the internet or reading books.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I had got my first job in tech, I decided to take my education further and enrolled in some courses in web development, Mobile Development and Design and recently on a bachelor's degree in Digital Technology, Design and Innovation.

      <p>
          I consider myself an experimentalist and a long life learner. I'm always trying to learn something new and pushing boundaries. I'm the type of UI Developer that cares about design and user experience.  I love to prototype, explore new ideas and being part of creative teams. Always trying to explore new front-end technologies, data and audio visualisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My friends say that I'm a geek, but I like to say that I'm a friendly geek. I like to travel, making music and create open source projects.
